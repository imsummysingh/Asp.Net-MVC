    If you want the page to open in a new window,
    1. Right click on "Views" folder, and add "Shared" folder.
    2. Right click on "Shared" folder, and add "DisplayTemplates" folder.



    3. Right click on DisplayTemplates folder, and add a view. Set "Url" as the name and use Razor view engine.
    4. Copy and paste the following code in Url.cshtml view
    <a href="@ViewData.Model" target="_blank">@ViewData.Model</a>

    That's it. Build the application and click on the link. Notice that, the page, now opens in a new window. The downside of this approach is that, from now on all the links, will open in a new window. To overcome this, follow these steps.
    1. Rename Url.cshtml to OpenInNewWindow.cshtml
    2. Decorate "PersonalWebSite" property in EmployeeMetaData class with UIHint attribute and specify the name of the template to use. In our case, the name of the template is "OpenInNewWindow".
    public class EmployeeMetaData
    {
    [DataType(DataType.Url)]
    [UIHint("OpenInNewWindow")]
    public string PersonalWebSite { get; set; }
    }
